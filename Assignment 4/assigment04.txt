from slowest to fastest:

1. n!: This expression represents a linear function of n, where the constant of proportionality is 20. As n increases, 20n increases at a steady rate, but at a slower pace than exponential functions.

2. 3^n: This expression grows at a significantly faster rate than the other polynomial expressions. As n increases, 3^n grows exponentially, albeit at a slower rate than n!.

3. 20n: This expression grows linearly with respect to n. As n increases, 20n increases at a steady rate, but at a slower pace than exponential functions.

4. 4n^2: This expression grows quadratically with respect to n. As n increases, 4n^2 increases at a faster rate than linear functions, but at a slower pace than exponential functions.

5. n^2/3: This expression grows as a sublinear power of n. As n increases, n^2/3 increases at a slower rate than linear functions.

6. log3 n: This expression grows logarithmically with respect to n. As n increases, log3 n increases at a very slow rate.

7. log2 n: This expression grows logarithmically with respect to n, but at a slightly faster rate than log3 n due to the base of the logarithm.

8. 2: This expression has a constant value of 2, regardless of the value of n. It grows the slowest among all the given expressions.

In summary, the order of growth rate from slowest to fastest is:

2 < log2 n < log3 n < n^2/3 < 20n < 4n^2 < 3^n < n!

(a)	O(1)

(b) O(n)
(c) O(n^2)
(d) O(n^2)
(e) O(n log n)
(f) O(n)
(g) O(n^2 log n)


(a) The code fragment consists of two assignment statements, which are constant-time operations. Therefore, the complexity is O(1).

(b) The code fragment consists of a nested loop, where the outer loop runs 3 times and the inner loop runs n times. Therefore, the complexity is O(3n) = O(n).
